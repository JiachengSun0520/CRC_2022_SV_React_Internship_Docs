# Filter

&nbsp;

## Overview
The Filter is used to filter the result based on user selection. Users can filter on variables of different types including numberic, text, or visual filters. For each type of variable, there are different filter components including range sliders, multi-selections with autocomplete, and bounding boxes on the map. These filters will carry along in the Voyage app and Past app and affect other components. This page will introduce these filters extensively.

- click on the slider bar to change the range
- enter values in the input boxes to change the range
